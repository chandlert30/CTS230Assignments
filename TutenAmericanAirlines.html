        <p class="intro">The Coronavirus is affecting many industries, and causing a lot of harm to businesses all over
            the United States.
            No better example is with the airline industry, since the demand for travel has decreased, it has caused
            companies like American Airlines to cut costs and cut, in this case, labor. American Airlines is not the
            only
            company doing this, Southwest and Delta Airlines are doing the same thing to preserve revenue.</p>

        <p class="conclusion">In class today, we learned about supply and costs of production. In this case, we are
            seeing the affects of
            Coronavirus, a natural event, that has caused the supply curve to shift left and caused the demand curve to
            shift left. <img src="Images/download.jpg" alt="American Airlines Image" title="American Airlines Image"
                width=400  id="img1100"> 
            The leftward shift in supply is what is causing the many workers to be laid off because the company
            cannot afford to keep them since the costs of production are to high especially if they are not making
            enough profit, due to the decrease in demand. This is why we are seeing examples like, “American Airlines said it
            would shed 19,000 workers by Oct. 1 as the carrier prepares to downsize to cope with the coronavirus blow to
            travel demand.” The airline companies, like American Airlines, are doing this to decrease variable costs, another
            term we learned today, in order to reduce total cots and to make as much profit as they can to survive this
            natural disaster. However, Airlines want to stop this mass amount of job loss in their industry, and they are asking
            for a factor that would keep supply from decreasing, and that is government subsidy, “Unions and airline
            officials have advocated for another round of funds to keep employees on the job through March 2021.” A government
            subsidy, like the one suggested in the quote, would allow airlines to keep their inputs and decrease costs
            of production and therefore, keep supply from decreasing until demand rises when Coronavirus disappears.</p>
