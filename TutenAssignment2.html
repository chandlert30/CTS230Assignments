        <h1>“Alibaba’s Online Orders Soar During Coronavirus, Fueling a Sales Recovery”</h1>
    </center>   
	<p>Due to the Coronavirus, many people have been looking for alternative ways to shop, especially for necessities</br> such as food, water, toilet paper, etc.  This gave way for companies like Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce </br> that is similar to Amazon, to have increased profits. </br>  The Chinese tech company reported that their fiscal first-quarter profit had more than doubled from the same </br> period a year earlier.  With e-commerce companies in China like Alibaba having increased revenues, it allowed for</br> the Chinese economy to bounce back after a contraction in the first couple months of 2020.</br>  This made China, the first major economy to return to positive growth since the pandemic began.</p>
