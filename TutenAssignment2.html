        <h1>“Alibaba’s Online Orders Soar During Coronavirus, Fueling a Sales Recovery”</h1>
    </center>
    <p>Due to the Coronavirus, many people have been looking for alternative ways to shop, especially for
        necessities</br> such as food, water, toilet paper, etc. This gave way for companies like Alibaba, a Chinese
        e-commerce </br> that is similar to Amazon, to have increased profits. </br> The Chinese tech company reported
        that their fiscal first-quarter profit had more than doubled from the same </br> period a year earlier. With
        e-commerce companies in China like Alibaba having increased revenues, it allowed for</br> the Chinese economy to
        bounce back after a contraction in the first couple months of 2020.</br> This made China, the first major
        economy to return to positive growth since the pandemic began.</p>

        <p>In the afternoon work today, we read and had some practice problems related to the concept of demand. We</br>
            learned that there are factors that can affect demand and either shift them positively or negatively which
            can</br> increase or decrease revenue. This article relates to positive demand shift because due to the
            Coronavirus,</br> people’s preferences have changed from shopping in person for goods, to online-shopping for
            those same goods,</br> “consumers’ shopping habits became more entrenched during widespread lockdowns due to the
            virus outbreak.”</br> Changes in tastes and preferences is a factor that causes demand to shift and in this case
            the change in preference</br> is a positive one. Therefore, this rise in demand for Alibaba, as well as other
            e-commerce companies in China, has</br> caused their revenues to rise along with their quantity demanded. A
            point that is emphasized by Steven Zhu, an</br> analyst at research firm Pacific Epoch, “The Coronavirus has
            been good for Chinese e-commerce players.” The</br> increase in online shopping caused by the Coronavirus may
            start a new trend that sees more people shopping at</br> home than in stores due to this dramatic change in
            consumer preference.</p>
