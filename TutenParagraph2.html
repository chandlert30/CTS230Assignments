    <h1>Alibaba Essay Paragraph 2</h1>

    <p>In the afternoon work today, we read and had some practice problems related to the concept of demand. We</br>
        learned that there are factors that can affect demand and either shift them positively or negatively which
        can</br> increase or decrease revenue. This article relates to positive demand shift because due to the
        Coronavirus,</br> people’s preferences have changed from shopping in person for goods, to online-shopping for
        those same goods,</br> “consumers’ shopping habits became more entrenched during widespread lockdowns due to the
        virus outbreak.”</br> Changes in tastes and preferences is a factor that causes demand to shift and in this case
        the change in preference</br> is a positive one. Therefore, this rise in demand for Alibaba, as well as other
        e-commerce companies in China, has</br> caused their revenues to rise along with their quantity demanded. A
        point that is emphasized by Steven Zhu, an</br> analyst at research firm Pacific Epoch, “The Coronavirus has
        been good for Chinese e-commerce players.” The</br> increase in online shopping caused by the Coronavirus may
        start a new trend that sees more people shopping at</br> home than in stores due to this dramatic change in
        consumer preference.</p>
